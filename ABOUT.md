## Intro

Facebook is broken. It grabbed people when they were sharing their personal
stuff. Then people started to share links... Now you don't know how Facebook
sorts and why it shows to you news. But their goal is obvious to keep you in
the app for as long as they can whatever it costs.

Young people don't care about facebook. It's irrelevant to them. But they still
want to consume news.

**Radd** is a flexible modern way to follow online sources. Think about RSS
reader that is works in the messanger app.
